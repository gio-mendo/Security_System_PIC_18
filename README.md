# Security_System_PIC_18
Developed with PIC18 + MPLAB IDE

The objective of this project was to design and build a basic security system that will trigger an alarm when there is a person near. 
An edge interrupt was configured for a PIR sensor used to detect change in heat emitted from people. A sine wave will be feed to an op amp connected to a 3D printed minispeaker. The frequency of the sine wave can be controlled through the ADC values read from a 10K potentiometer. 
A bipolar stepper motor is used to sweep the PIR sensor. Since the PIR sensor detects change in temperature, this system will detect a static person or a person moving.
